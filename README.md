# Introduction
FeeShare is a platform that combines DAO tooling with a new EigenLayer AVS solution to incentivize smart contract developers on the Swellchain network by redistributing a portion of the transaction fees their contracts generate. Leveraging the infrastructure of both EigenLayer and Swellchain, FeeShare fosters a decentralized reward mechanism that drives participation and innovation in the ecosystem.
